# Overview

Welcome to the ONNX course repository! This project is designed to help you convert various machine learning models to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format. ONNX provides an open-source format for AI models, making it easier to move them between different frameworks and optimize them for performance.

This repository includes examples and guides for converting models from:

    PyTorch
    Scikit-Learn
    TensorFlow
    YOLO (You Only Look Once)
    Hugging Face

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To use the scripts in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Directory Structure

Each directory contains specific scripts and instructions for converting models from the respective frameworks to ONNX.
